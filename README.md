# Shmup JS #

A very simple side scrolling shooter written in Typescript

It was developed to try out typescript and HTML5 canvas neither of which I had used before at the time. 

It's written in a very OOP style because I wanted to try out classes in TS which is not my usual style and is not the recomended route for game engines as a rule.

Press 1 to start arrow keys to move and space to fire.

"npm build" to build the Typescript and "npm start" to fire up an http server and a browser window.
